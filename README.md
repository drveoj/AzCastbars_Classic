# AzCastbars_Classic

Initial release including AzCastbars updates for classic support. Awaiting Aezay response to include in official release.

Key in this version is acbTargetBarClassic which has a working Target castbar (called "Classic Target") plugin. 

Disable the "builtin" Target castbar (called "Target") in Az config settings and use Classic Target instead
